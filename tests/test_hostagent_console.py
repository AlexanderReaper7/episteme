"""The host agent's tray icon and text UI (`hostagent/console.py`).

Loaded by path like the agent itself, and for the same reason: it runs on the
Windows host, not in the container, so it is not part of the package.

What is worth testing here is narrow and specific. Not that Textual draws (it
does), but that the two things a person reads at a glance are right: the colour
of the tray light, and whether a log pane splices one server's output onto
another's after a restart. Both have exactly one correct answer and neither is
visible in a screenshot taken at the wrong moment.
