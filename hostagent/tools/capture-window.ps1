# Screenshots one window by class and title, whether or not it is on top.
#
# DPI awareness FIRST, and that is the whole reason this file exists rather than a
# one-liner: without it the shell virtualises `GetWindowRect` for this process, so
# a 1815x921 window measures 877x493, the bitmap comes out that size, and
# `PrintWindow` renders only the top left corner into it. On screen that reads
# exactly like "the right hand side of the title bar is not being drawn", which is
# a bug in the app that does not exist.
#
# `PrintWindow` asks the window to paint itself, so it does not capture anything
# drawn on the SCREEN dc over the top. The minimize-to-tray wireframe
# (`DrawAnimatedRects`) is invisible here by construction, not by failure.
