# No PEP-723 header here on purpose: uv resolves the header of the script it is

# authoritative and install nothing.
"""Tray icon, console-window control and a text UI for the host agent.

The agent has always been correct and invisible. What it was not is *present*:
llama-server ran in whichever terminal the launcher was typed into, the embed
server owned a minimized taskbar button of its own, and the agent had no face at
all. Three desktop artefacts for one logical service, and the only way to read a
log was to have Docker up and the admin page open, which is precisely not the
case when something is wrong.

So both servers go headless (they already write everything to `logs/*.log`) and
this module becomes the one window: a tray icon that is also a status light, and
a console you show and hide from it.

**It is injected, never imported into.** `AgentAPI` below is the entire surface,
and `llama_agent.main` fills it in. That is not ceremony: `tests/test_hostagent`
loads the agent by path under the module name `llama_agent`, so a plain
`import llama_agent` from here would build a SECOND module object with its own
`_lifecycle_lock` and its own `_games_cache` - two agents disagreeing inside one
process, which is the kind of bug that presents as "the lock sometimes does
nothing".

Windows notes, both learned the hard way and both load-bearing:

* `GetConsoleWindow()` returns whatever console this process is ATTACHED to, not
  one it owns. Run by hand from a terminal, that is the user's terminal, so
  hiding it or deleting its close button would vandalize a window we were merely
  borrowing. Hence `owns_console`: the destructive calls happen only when the
  caller passed `--hide`, which only the scheduled task does.
* Under Windows 11 the default terminal is Windows Terminal, where the console
  window is a pseudo-console the real UI does not live in and `ShowWindow` moves
  nothing the eye can see. `install-task.ps1` therefore launches through
  `conhost.exe` explicitly, which is the classic host these calls were designed
  against.
